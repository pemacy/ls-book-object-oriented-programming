Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a Symbol that represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of ruby's datatypes.

A Symbol represents a name inside the ruby interpreter. See Symbol for more details on what symbols are and when ruby creates them internally.

You may reference a symbol using a colon: :my_symbol.

You may also create symbols by interpolation:

ex: :PrestonMacy
